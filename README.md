# Testing-arrays-in-Cplusplus
College homework, testing arrays in c++!

I got a homework from my college, we had to create a array of informations about prices related to two sectors (Nursery and Apartament). 
Basically the user send to the software which sector is going to be used, input 0 - Nursery; 1 - Apartament; 9 - Exit.
Then it will ask how many lives will be included in the plan and so, multiply the base price with the "lives" input.

finalPrice = array[SectorInput][j] * lives;

PS: My entire code is in portuguese.
